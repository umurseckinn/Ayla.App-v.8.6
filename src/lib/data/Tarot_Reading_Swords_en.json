Perhaps you were in a very complex situation and with an enlightenment that came at that moment, you put everything into place. That brave and sharp decision you took in that period allowed you to become much more free emotionally and to act with your own truths. This 'confronting the truth' state from those days is the biggest reason why you still seek such an honest and clear bond in love today. You discovered back then that love is not just about feeling, but also about understanding.",
        "simdi": "Darling, you are currently in a complete 'decision-making' and 'logic' period in your love life; literally the smoke screen is clearing and you see everything in its full nakedness! If you have a relationship, the time has come to solve the problems between you by talking and producing logical solutions. If you are single, you trust the truths of your mind more than the voice of your heart and prepare your mind for an honest partner who truly deserves you. This card whispers to focus not on your emotions but on the naked truth in love right now and to swing that sword and break the bonds pulling you down if necessary. You are on the verge of a mental victory!",
        "gelecek": "The magnificent clarity waiting for you in your future regarding love seems to radically change your life and eliminate all question marks. You will catch such an intellectual harmony and honesty with that person that no secrets will remain between you.

In the future, while living the most honest and intelligent form of love, you will be surprised how your soul is lightened by this clarity. Get ready darling, the most 'enlightened' love period of your life is starting very soon."

Perhaps you started a project that no one dared to, or you drew your sword in a moment of crisis and showed the most logical way. This visionary and fearless stance in those days earned your professional identity immense authority and respect. That period where you used your logic and analysis skills at the highest level still causes you to be pointed out in the business world today. You proved back then that success is not just working hard, but giving the right decision at the right time.",

Success is waiting at the door, just swing that sword with confidence and declare your victory, darling.",

Perhaps you got out of a debt trap with that determined stance or made a very smart investment, multiplying the value of your money. It was a very productive and honest period where you saw money not as a power but as a tool to build your freedom. This 'logical and clear' financial stance from those days allows you to look at money more safely and strategically even today. You discovered back then that abundance comes not just with luck, but with the right decision, darling.",

Perhaps you will sign an important contract or take a very radical investment decision for your financial future. This period is the time to receive the reward of cutting off emotional spending completely and focusing only on logical and long-term plans.

Perhaps you successfully went through an important surgery or implemented that radical decision that would radically change your lifestyle with a sword's sharpness. Those days when you felt very fit and mentally clear showed you how resilient your body is. This 'disciplined and clear' healing power you gained back then has been the greatest architect of your solid and glowing state today. You understood back then that the way to take good care of your body is through clearing your mind first.",

Those days when you approached life like a leader—honest and visionary—have been the biggest supporters of your vision today.

Perhaps you swung that sword without fully understanding or listening, and actually cut off your greatest happiness. This 'misunderstanding' and 'communication breakdown' back then somewhat damaged your pure faith in love and left you alone with regrets. Those days when you became a victim of your own anger or pride trigger the fear of 'am I making a mistake again?' even today when opening your heart to someone new. You lost love while trying to defend your own truths in love for a while, darling.",
        "simdi": "Honey, you might be experiencing a period of 'mental confusion' and 'wrong decisions' in your love life right now; it's as if you can't see anything clearly. You might be acting very harsh, critical, and hurtful toward your partner, which weakens that beautiful bond between you every passing day. Perhaps you don't want to accept a truth and your mind is constantly playing games with you. This card says you need to stop for a moment, put that sword back in its scabbard, and find the balance between your emotions and logic. You are in a mental turmoil; don't make any radical decisions before you calm down, honey.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, in some situations you will experience regarding love, there is a risk of pushing your partner away due to excessive rationalism or cruel honesty. That person who looks 'intelligent' might actually be someone who manipulates you mentally and drains your energy. Moving away from empathy by saying 'I know the best' might drag you into the same ice-cold loneliness in the future. However, this process will be a lesson given for you to learn to see with your heart, not just your mind, in love. If you want to establish a real bond in the future, you must learn to use that sword as a light, not as a weapon."

Perhaps you had a very brilliant idea but it was rejected because you presented it with the wrong style, or you were treated unfairly. While expecting a rise in your career, you might have slipped due to your own stubbornness or strategic mistakes. This 'mental blockage' and 'authority problems' back then still cast a shadow on your professional self-confidence today and make you afraid of taking risks. You drew your sword against the wrong person and at the wrong time in the business world, darling.",
        "simdi": "Honey, you might feel yourself in a 'chaos' and 'fear of failure' in business life right now; you literally can't bring any project to a conclusion. Your mind is so scattered that you think a thousand times even when making the simplest decisions and still choose the wrong way. Perhaps you were treated unfairly at work and this made you very angry and unproductive. This card whispers that you should completely change your strategy right now and be very careful in written agreements and signatures. You are in a victim psychology and feel as if your sword is blunt; you need to refresh your mind immediately.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, some legal problems, blocked projects, and big disappointments appear regarding your career plans, darling. If you are expecting an important signature, the fact that this signature is not signed or the conditions turn completely against you might annoy you quite a bit. You have a risk of losing a great opportunity to your rivals because of your arrogance or wrong analyses in business life. If you want to achieve success, don't give up on your dreams but be more modest and strategic about how to protect them. If you want to be successful in the future, you must give up that 'I know everything' attitude, darling."

In that period when you used your ambition, not your logic, while managing money, your wallet must have weakened considerably and your peace fled. Perhaps the lack of abundance of an investment tired you quite a bit back then, and the places where you said 'I will earn money from this business' let you down. This financial disappointment causes you to approach money always with the fear of 'it will never be enough' and 'will I lose again?' today. You took risks for your ego, not for your financial freedom, back then, darling.",
        "simdi": "Honey, a period of 'unplannedness' and 'inability to decide' prevails in your wallet right now; money appears to be coming but you can't track where it goes. You might be inclined to believe groundless news or wrong investment advice in financial matters; please be very careful! This period says the conditions are not suitable at all for making a financial agreement and the risk of a legal glitch is high. You are in a time frame where you need to act with concrete data, not your emotions or ambition. You should master your expenses and protect your wallet from external influences.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, some losses you will experience in financial sense might grow further due to a wrong signature or a court/bank process. Panicking in a financial crisis and swinging the sword at the wrong place—that is, making a wrong investment—could lead you to a major bankruptcy. If you avoid the disciplined struggle you must give to protect your money, you might lose all your financial power in the future. In this process, it is essential to learn to be patient and use your logic rather than your ambition while managing money. To prosper in the future, you must get rid of the complex and unplanned spending in your wallet now."

While your body was giving alarms, you were so busy with those unending ambitions or conflicts in your mind that you couldn't show the necessary care to your health. Perhaps you underwent a very risky medical intervention or the healing process was prolonged due to a mistake. This 'mental resistance' state triggers the fear of 'is there something serious?' even at the slightest fatigue today. Back then, you listened to the voice of your ego, not the voice of your body, honey.",
        "simdi": "Honey, your body is currently in 'mental fatigue' and 'nervous tension'; your unending indecision is exhausting every cell! You are forcing yourself so much that your brain has reached the point of giving an error. This card cries out that you urgently need to take a break, do a digital detox, or at least be silent for a bit. You cannot save the whole world; you must first sharpen that blunt sword in your own mind and calm down. Please put aside those sharp and hurtful thoughts; otherwise a serious health problem is inevitable very soon, darling.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, a process that will challenge you regarding health and where you will deal especially with head/nervous system-related issues awaits you. As long as you see taking care of yourself as a 'waste of time,' reaching full vitality will be that much more difficult and painful. The physical fatigues you will encounter in the future will be a result of your current suppressed anger and wrong decisions. You might have to enter a very radical and restrictive treatment program to regain your health in the future. If you don't learn to silence that ambitious warrior within you now, your body will one day force you to stop."

Acting harshly in love, breaking people in work, and saying 'nothing happens to me' in health might have led you to some deep regrets today. Those days when you lost your inner peace and truths while trying to manage the lives of others have left a deep wound in your soul. You swung your sword against life not as a light but as a weapon, and this has isolated you, darling. This 'wrong use of power' back then still makes you restless today.",

Whichever job you touch, it stays in your hand; the news you expect always comes incomplete or wrong; your energy is crawling on the floor. This card whispers that this 'scattered and indecisive' state has extinguished that bright intelligence within you. Why did you fall apart so easily and why did you make everything so complex? You must pull yourself together immediately and hold the ropes of your life not with your emotions, but only with your logic. You might be a champion but your sword is very rusty right now; time to clean it.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, some major obstacles, legal problems, and wrong decisions in the general rhythm of life might be waiting for you, darling. Much more discipline and honesty than you expect will be needed for those big changes you planned to happen. Instead of thinking 'I can do everything' in love and work, you should make a more modest defense plan against the difficulties you will encounter. The sword of victory life will offer you will not light immediately, or it might burn you when it lights, so you must be very careful. If you learn to be patient and look at events from a wider window, that true big victory will be yours."

A decision was needed, but perhaps because of your fears, you chose to close your eyes and ignore the events. This 'standstill' and 'indecision' caused you to stall in your career for a while. But that silent waiting actually taught you how important it is to listen to your inner voice. You discovered back then that sometimes stopping is also an action in the business world.",

There is a very important matter you need to decide on, but right now you don't want to accept any data and choose to leave events as they are. This card says you are trying to stay in balance instead of choosing a side, but this uncertainty is eating you up inside. The time has come to remove the blindfold and face the truths, but you still take refuge in that comfortable silence. A little courage darling, the truths might hurt but they will set you free.",

You will reach such a point that both options will look equally attractive or risky to you; so you might wait without deciding for a while longer. Even though this process will tire you mentally, you will eventually find such a middle way that you will surprise everyone.

This 'financial blockage' feeling causes you to approach money always with the fear of 'am I making a mistake?' today. You stayed silent in those days not for financial freedom, but to not take risks, darling. That silence taught you how to protect money but not how to multiply it.",

There is an investment opportunity, but you are so afraid of risks that you choose to close your eyes and act as if nothing is happening. This card says you are trying to establish financial balance right now, but this passive state actually deprives you of gain. In this period where you stopped the flow of money, you should leave those two swords in your mind on the ground and focus on concrete data. You are literally in a waiting room for your wallet right now!",

A property sale or a major investment issue will come to the agenda, but you will wear yourself out for a long time wondering whether to say 'yes' or 'no.' In this process, if you don't get expert support, your cash might lose value due to your indecision. To reach financial independence in the future, it will be essential to remove the blindfold and face the actual figures when that moment comes.

This 'indecision' and 'passivity' perhaps caused a small problem to take longer to heal. You understood the value of health much better in those silent and dark days of waiting.

This 'mandatory health awakening' triggers the fear of 'will it get worse again?' even at the slightest fatigue today. Back then, you listened to the silence of your fears, not the voice of your body, honey.",

Your eyes are open, but the tired picture you see panics you more, and this situation might be hitting your heart or blood pressure. This card cries out that you urgently need to see an expert and leave the confusion within you aside and focus on your physical treatment. Everything you neglected is piling up right now and you don't know which one to cope with. Please leave those swords on the ground and just show compassion to your body; otherwise a collapse is inevitable very soon.",

Those days when you saw taking care of yourself as an 'unnecessary detail' will come across as chronic pains in the future. If you start a treatment, there is a risk of the process becoming a chaos due to your lack of discipline and indecision. You might have to make a very radical and perhaps painful lifestyle change to regain your health in the future. If you don't give up that 'eyes closed' state now, your body will wake you up one day in the harshest way."

Those days spent among disappointment in love, lies in work, and negligence in health made you more aggressive and equally timid today. Because you stopped at the moments you had to decide, life gave the harshest decisions for you and this must have worn you out quite a bit.

Whichever job you touch, you encounter a lie; the news you expect always comes in a way that will shake you; your energy is like a fire pit. This card whispers that this 'scattered and angry' state has completely destroyed your common sense. Why were you so late and why did you persist so much in not seeing the truths? You must pull yourself together immediately, take your swords under control, and hold the ropes of your life with wisdom, not anger. You are not a victim, just a hero experiencing a harsh awakening.",

If you continue to deceive yourself by saying 'everything is fine' in love and work, the chaos you will encounter in the future might completely finish you. The big lesson life will offer you will not end immediately and will make you sweat quite a bit, so you should open your eyes now. If you learn to be patient and look at events without masks now, that true big peace will be yours."

This professional 'heartache' you experienced back then completely ended your pure faith in the business world and made you much more distant.

Perhaps you defeated a disease only with the correct diagnoses and a disciplined treatment, or you successfully completed a tough regime that would take your body to the highest level. This 'rational healing' power you gained in that period was the biggest architect of your solid and authoritative stance today. You understood back then more than enough that the way to take good care of your body is through clearing your mind first, honey.",
        "simdi": "Honey, right now your health energy is working at full capacity and discipline; you feel literally as fit and clear as a sage!

This card heralds that you have completely defeated a health glitch if you had one through an honest treatment or your general well-being has peaked. Your light and life energy are noticed even from the outside, you are literally shining with health and that asalet worthy of queens, darling.",

You lived that honest bond in love, that magnificent success in work, and that unshakable discipline in health at the same time, literally being one with the universe. Those days when everyone respected you and benefited from those honest decisions of yours are the strongest part of your character even today. You proved to the whole world back then how to stand honest and wise in every area of life, honey. Success was engraved in your soul back then like a royal seal.",

You are in a magnificent balance where you enjoy honesty in love, establishing authority in work, and financial prosperity at the same time. Your self-confidence is so high that every step you take arouses admiration and a bit of respectful hesitation around you. This card says that it is a 'strategy victory' time for you and you should maintain all the victories you have won with honesty. Life greets you honey, you are a wise leader who manages the world with his intelligence right now.",

Perhaps your partner was very manipulative and someone who beat you with his words or you defended your own truths so harshly that you broke the heart of the person across from you. This 'emotional drought' and 'destructive honesty' state back then causes you to exhibit a more prejudiced and harsh stance toward love even today. While you were trying to protect your own mind in love, you lost love for a period, darling.",
        "simdi": "Honey, right now you might be experiencing a 'communication accident' and 'manipulation' period in your love life; it's as if you want everything to be your way. You might be acting very harsh, critical, and even sarcastic toward your partner, which breaks that beautiful bond between you more and more every day. If you are single, you exhibit such an unapproachable and arrogant attitude that the hearts of those who want to approach you turn back from the door. This card whispers that you are using your intelligence right now not to love, but to come out right. You should soften up a bit and see love not as a logic test, but as a heart sharing, honey.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, in some situations you will experience in the name of love, you have the risk of experiencing big breakups because of your extreme harshness or resorting to lies. That 'intelligent' looking person you will encounter might be a tiran who sours you mentally and turns everything to his own advantage. Your moving away completely from empathy by saying 'I know the best' in your relationships might drag you again into the same ice-cold loneliness in the future. However, this process will be a lesson given for you to learn to see not only with your mind but also with your soul in love. If you want to find peace in the future, you will need to learn to use that sword not as a weapon, but as a torch."

Perhaps you were very talented but your reputation was shaken a bit because you looked down on people or resorted to unfair ways. Those steps you took with the ambition of 'I am the only one who knows' in your career must have pushed you into a big deadlock professionally for a period. Those 'despotic' and 'unjust' attitudes in those days cause you to act always with a fear of 'being caught' or 'making a mistake' in business life today. You used your intelligence in the wrong place and at the wrong time to crush people in the business world, darling.",
        "simdi": "Honey, right now you are experiencing a complete 'power poisoning' or on the contrary, a magnificent anger because you were treated unfairly; you are in constant conflict with those around you. Trying to control everything at work but breaking people makes you a very tense and unbearable state. This card says that this current 'harsh and manipulative' attitude of yours could cause serious damage to your career and open big legal problems. Please step back a bit, respect the ideas of others and don't turn into a dictator while trying to lead. Where you should stop right now is to put that sword in its scabbard and try to be a bit tolerant.",

Because of your ambition for an important project or position, you might compromise on honesty and level everything to the ground at once. You have a risk of winning the hatred of those around you by using your charisma and intelligence wrongly in business life, and this might leave you very alone in the future. If you want to reach success, you will need to learn not to beat people with your intelligence, but to guide them. Otherwise, that career kingdom you dream of will never be yours, be aware."

Those uncalculated spendings or wrong investments you made saying 'I know every law, every way' brought you to the brink of legal crises for a period. Those days when you used money as a show of power and crushed people financially might be following you today. This 'financial show-off' curiosity in that period causes you to approach money always with a fear of 'it will never be enough' and 'will I lose again?' today. You spent money for your ego, not for your financial freedom, in those days, honey.",

Trying to show your financial situation much better than it is or trying to obtain gain by using legal gaps might be dragging you into a big disaster. This card whispers that instead of protecting your financial resources, you are burning them like a fire of ambition. You should urgently make a budget plan and understand that money is a temporary power and real power is in honesty. Time has come to cut those 'manipulative' spendings in your wallet right now, otherwise everything will be consumed.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, some losses you will experience in financial sense might grow even more because of your arrogance, legal mistakes, and wrong investment decisions. Not listening to the honest advice of others in a financial crisis and insisting by saying 'my word is right' could lead you to a big bankruptcy. If you avoid that modest struggle you must give to protect your money, you might lose all your financial power and respect in the future. In this process, it is a must to learn to be patient and use your ethical values, not your ambition, while managing money. If you want to get rich in the future, you should get rid of those royal fantasies in your wallet now."

Perhaps you dealt with nervous system or head pains for a period because your mind couldn't handle that high fiery tempo and arrogance. You understand better now how much you neglected your health back then and how you acted like a tiran to your body. You silenced the voice of your body in those times not like a wise person, but like a cruel person, honey.",

You are forcing yourself so much under the mask of honesty that your brain has reached the point of giving an error now. This card cries out that you should urgently take a break right now, meditate, or at least shut up for a bit. You cannot manage the whole world, you should first take that sharp sword in your mind under control. Please put aside those arrogant and hurtful thoughts; otherwise you have a risk of experiencing a serious health problem very soon, darling.",
        "gelecek": "In your future, a process appears that will challenge you quite a bit regarding health and where you will deal especially with diseases caused by mental fatigue. As long as you see taking care of yourself as a 'weakness', your healing will also be that much delayed and painful. The physical fatigues you will encounter in the future and especially head/neck-related problems will be a result of your current obsession with control. In the future, you might have to enter into a very radical and perhaps painful lifestyle change program to regain your health. If you don't learn to silence that angry and arrogant king within you now, your body will stop you one day by force."

Those days when you lost your inner peace and honesty while trying to manage the lives of others have left a deep void in your soul. You shook your wand against life not like a king, but like a despot, and this left you alone, honey. This 'wrong power' use back then still makes you restless today.",

This card whispers that this current 'harsh and oppressive' state of yours drags you to the edge of the abyss. Why did you become so aggressive and why are you pushing everyone away from you? You must pull yourself together immediately, learn to be modest, and take the ropes of your life not with anger, but with love. You can be a king but remember that real kings rule with mercy, not honesty.",

However, this situation is your choice; whether to use your intelligence as a light or as a sword is completely in your hands. If you want to find peace in the future, you should be cleansed of your arrogance now."
